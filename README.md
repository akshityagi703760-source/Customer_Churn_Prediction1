## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer data to predict which customers are likely to churn (leave the service). The model helps businesses identify at-risk customers early so they can take proactive retention measures.

**Key Results:**
- Model Accuracy: 84.7% ROC-AUC score
- Identifies 80% of customers who will churn
- Estimated annual savings: $400,000+
- Interactive web dashboard for real-time predictions

## Dataset

**Source:** Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle

**Size:** 7,043 customer records

**Features:**
- Customer demographics (gender, age, dependents)
- Services subscribed (phone, internet, streaming)
- Account information (contract type, payment method, tenure)
- Billing (monthly charges, total charges)

**Target Variable:** Churn (Yes/No) - 26.5% of customers churned

## Key Findings

**Main factors that cause customers to churn:**

1. Contract type - Month-to-month contracts have 42% churn vs 3% for two-year contracts
2. Tenure - New customers (less than 6 months) churn at 50% rate
3. Payment method - Electronic check users churn at 45%
4. Tech support - Customers without tech support churn 15% more
5. Monthly charges - Higher charges correlate with higher churn

## Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed patterns in customer behavior
- Identified key factors related to churn
- Created visualizations to understand the data

### 2. Feature Engineering
Created 14 new features including:
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Average Monthly Spend
- Service count
- Tenure groups
- Contract risk indicator
- New customer flag
- Premium service usage indicators

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values in TotalCharges column
- Converted categorical variables to numbers
- Applied one-hot encoding for multi-category features
- Split data into 80% training and 20% testing
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler

### 4. Handling Imbalanced Data
- Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
- Balanced the training data from 26.5% to 50% churn ratio
- This improved the model's ability to detect churners

### 5. Model Training
Trained and compared 6 different models:
- Logistic Regression ⭐
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

**Best Model:** Logistic Regression with 84.7% ROC-AUC

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Precision: 68.9%
- Recall: 80.2%
- F1-Score: 74.1%
- ROC-AUC: 84.7%

**Why these metrics matter:**
- Recall (80.2%) means we catch 80% of customers who will churn
- Precision (68.9%) means 69% of our predictions are correct
- This is much better than random guessing (50%)

## Business Impact

**Assumptions:**
- Customer Lifetime Value: $2,000
- Retention campaign cost: $100 per customer
- Campaign success rate: 30%

**Results:**
- Correctly identifies 80% of churning customers
- Saves approximately 90 customers per quarter
- Annual revenue saved: $180,000
- Campaign costs: $40,000
- Net benefit: $140,000+ annually
- Return on investment: 350%
